            <h2>What Makes Guatemala Stand Out?</h2>
            <h3>1. Business-Friendly Environment</h3>
            <p>Guatemala offers a highly favorable environment for businesses, driven by its strategic location in Central America, which serves as a gateway between North and South America. The country boasts a diverse and dynamic economy with sectors 
                ranging from agriculture and manufacturing to tourism and services. Guatemala's government has implemented various policies and incentives to attract foreign investment, including tax breaks, simplified business registration processes, and free trade agreements 
                with key global markets. Additionally, the nation’s young and growing population provides a vibrant and skilled labor force, further enhancing its appeal to entrepreneurs and multinational corporations. The combination of competitive operational costs, modern infrastructure, 
                and a commitment to economic reforms makes Guatemala an attractive destination for business growth and investment.</p>
            <h3>2. Energy Hub</h3>
            <p>Guatemala is becoming an important energy hub in Central America due to its abundant natural resources and investments in energy infrastructure. The country has focused on expanding its renewable energy sources, including hydroelectric, geothermal, and solar power. 
                Hydroelectric power is especially significant, providing a large portion of Guatemala’s electricity. Additionally, Guatemala 
                is a key location for regional energy distribution, connecting power grids and enabling energy trade. The government's efforts 
                to modernize the energy sector and promote sustainability make Guatemala an attractive destination for energy investments.</p>
            <h3>3. Quality of Life</h3>
            <p>Guatemala offers a high quality of life with its rich cultural heritage, beautiful landscapes, and warm climate. The country is known for its friendly people, vibrant traditions, and delicious cuisine. With affordable living costs, residents enjoy a good standard of living. 
                Access to healthcare and education is improving, and the growing economy provides new opportunities for work and business. From its historic cities to stunning natural attractions, Guatemala is a wonderful place to live and explore.</p>
            <h3>4. Talented Workforce</h3>
            <p>Houston is home to a highly educated and diverse workforce. With over 60 colleges and universities in the Greater Houston area, businesses can tap into a pool of skilled professionals across various fields.</p>
            <h3>5. Infrastructure and Connectivity</h3>
            <p>Houston boasts a well-developed infrastructure with extensive road networks, a major international airport, and a growing public transportation system. Its strategic location enables businesses to efficiently reach customers, suppliers, and partners, both domestically and globally.</p>
